A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a web service that follows REST principles, allowing communication between a client and a server using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

Key Features of RESTful API:
>Stateless: Each request from the client contains all the information needed for the server to process it; no session state is stored on the server.

>Resource-Oriented: Data is represented as resources (e.g., users, orders) accessed via unique URLs.

>HTTP Methods:
GET: Retrieve data.
POST: Create new data.
PUT: Update existing data.
DELETE: Remove data.

Format: Uses standard formats like JSON or XML for request and response payloads.

Scalable and Platform-Independent: Can be used across different programming languages and platforms.
