Synchronous vs Asynchronous Functions

Synchronous Functions(Blocking): (fs.writeFileSync) -> (fs.readFileSync) ->
> Returns a Value: A synchronous function performs its operation and immediately returns a result (or throws an error) before proceeding to the next line of code.
> Blocking: It blocks the execution of subsequent code until the current operation is complete.

Asynchronous Functions(Non-Blocking): (fs.writeFile) -> (fs.readFile) ->
>Doesn't Directly Return a Value: An asynchronous function doesn't return the result immediately. Instead,
it performs the operation in the background and requires either:
- A callback function to handle the result/error, or
- A promise to handle the result asynchronously.
> Non-Blocking: It allows the execution of subsequent code while the operation is in progress.
