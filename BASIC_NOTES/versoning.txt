Versioning in Node.js =>
Versioning in Node.js follows the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) specification. SemVer is a versioning system designed to convey meaning about the changes introduced in a release and their compatibility with previous versions.

Node.js Versioning Format
Node.js versions are denoted as:
==> MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH <==
>MAJOR: Indicates breaking changes. Existing code may stop working after a major update.
>MINOR: Introduces new features that are backward-compatible.
>PATCH: Fixes bugs and makes improvements without changing the existing functionality.

Example:
Version 16.17.1:
16 = MAJOR version.
17 = MINOR version.
1 = PATCH version.

How to Specify Versions in package.json
In Node.js projects, dependencies are specified in the package.json file using SemVer:

Example:
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.17.1",
  "lodash": "~4.17.21"
}
Caret (^): Allows updates to the latest MINOR and PATCH versions.
^4.17.1 matches any version >=4.17.1 <5.0.0.

Tilde (~): Allows updates to the latest PATCH version only.
~4.17.21 matches any version >=4.17.21 <4.18.0.

Exact Version: Installs the specified version only.
"lodash": "4.17.21" installs exactly 4.17.21.
